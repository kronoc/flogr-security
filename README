 Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Flogr is a photoblog application powered by PHP, MySQL, and 
  Flickr. It is an easy to setup and easy to customize alternative 
  for folks that currently hack their own photoblog using MT or 
  Wordpress, or those trying to make Gallery or PixelPost work with 
  Flickr. If you use Flickr and want to have your own photoblog, 
  but don't want to hack blog software or upload the same pictures 
  multiple times (to flickr and pixelpost for example) then flogr 
  may be what you're after.
